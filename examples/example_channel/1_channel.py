"""
This file shows example of loading in touchstone file for differential channel and generating bode plot and impulse response

To run this file:
    - download zipped touchstone files from : https://www.ieee802.org/3/ck/public/tools/cucable/mellitz_3ck_04_1119_CACR.zip
    - Place the file Tp0_Tp5_28p5db_FQSFP_thru.s4p in the working directory, with this file. It contains s-paramater measurements for 2m copper cable connector with 28dB insertion loss at 26.56Ghz from IEEE 802.df public channels
    - create a subdirectory called 'data' in the working directory. this is where data generated from this script will be saved for use in other examples
